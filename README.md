# MY472-Final-Assignment
This repository contains the code and data necessary to reproduce my final project results

## Description of Data folder
- `mps_data.csv` contains the intermediary dataset post-web-scraping but prior to adding contituency-level data
- `questiona.csv` contains the full written and oral questions dataset used to compute the histogram and the outcome variable
- `ethnicity_2021.csv`, `ew_census_socioeconomic.csv` and `ew_education_data.csv` contain the 2021 Census data for England and Wales
- `northern_ireland_ethnicity.csv`, `ni_socioeconomic_data.csv`, `ni_education_data.csv` contain the 2021 Census data for Northern Ireland
- `scottish_ethnicity_data.csv`, `scotland_socioeconomic_data.csv`, `Scotland_education_data.csv` contains the 2021 Census data for Scotland
Overall, these files should be sufficient to run the whole analysis without needing to rescrape any data
